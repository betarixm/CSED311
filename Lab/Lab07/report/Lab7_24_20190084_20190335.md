# Introduction
<!--
- What you have to design & implement
- What you have to learn
-->

# Design
<!--
You should make an effort to write this section.
- How to divide a large module into submodules?
- How does each submodule operate?
- How to interconnect them?
If necessary, add a diagram to your report (handwritten diagram is also allowed)
-->

# Implementation

<!--
You should explain your Verilog code.
- The overall structure of your implementation
- A short, but meaningful description for non-trivial modules.
- The interaction between modules when they run a given scenario.
- Do NOT explain too much details of your implementation.
- Do NOT show the waveform results.
-->

# Discussion

<!--
- write anything valuable that you want to inform
For example:
- Important decisions you made
- Difficulties in designing and implementing, and your solutions for these
- Differences between your design and implementation, and the reasons for these.
- Feedback to TAs
-->

# Conclusion

<!--
don’t need to repeat the contents of the introduction section.
Just answer the following question:
- Did you succeed in achieving the goals described in the introduction section?
- If not, which goals could not be achieved? Why?
